# GGMM

GGMM is short for GGMM Generates Minutes Mail. It can process the meeting minutes created by zodbot,
and convert it to an email ready to send out semi-automatically. Currently it is used by FZUG to
generate the minutes mail of weekly meeting in #fedora-zh on freenode.

GGMM 可以半自动地把每周 #fedora-zh 的会议记录处理成 eml 格式。
